    "# Identifying and Defining\n",
    "## Defining Purpose \n",
    "__Data__: A collection of athlete data for the olympics for the last 120 years\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To determine the different qualities of a person that makes them more successful in the olympics\\\n",
    "__Source__: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results\\\n",
    "__Access__: The data is publicaly accessible on the Kaggle site\\\n",
    "__Access Method__: I will use it as a csv\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "### Data loading\n",
    "__Description__ : Load the data to for the other processes\\\n",
    "__Input__: A csv file\\\n",
    "__Outputs__: Pandas dataframe\n",
    "### Data cleaning\n",
    "__Description__ : Cleans the data to be able to be easily used by other functions. Some of the teams in the dataset aren't the country of origin, so it must be cleaned to be used as such\\\n",
    "__Input__: Pandas dataframe\\\n",
    "__Outputs__: An easily used pandas dataframe\n",
    "### Data analysis\n",
    "__Description__ : Converts the data into statistics and other forms of information about the data (aim to find trend for athletes)\\\n",
    "__Input__: A clean pandas dataframe about the data\\\n",
    "__Outputs__: New information about the data\n",
    "### Data visualisation\n",
    "__Description__ : Make certain charts to convey the meaning of the data more easily, like showing the which features are more successful for athletes\\\n",
    "__Input__: A clean pandas dataframe\\\n",
    "__Outputs__: A chart that conveys the data, probably using matplotlib\n",
    "### Data reporting\n",
    "__Description__ : Saves the new data that has been produced in a new location/Outputs the data to the user\\\n",
    "__Input__: Statistics about the data\\\n",
    "__Outputs__: A new file is created for the new dataset, or information has been outputted to the user\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "### Data loading\n",
    "__Actor__: User\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To load the csv file into the system\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: A readied csv file\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__: \n",
    "1. User places the file into the system \n",
    "2. System checks file type\n",
    "3. System loads file into a dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: Dataset is converted into a dataframe in the system to be used for data analysis\n",
    "### Data cleaning\n",
    "__Actor__: Data loading system\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To make the dataframe clean from any unhelpful data and makes the data easy to use. It will also make sure that a piece of code will run without error\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: A loaded dataframe\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__: \n",
    "1. Data loading process puts loaded dataframe into cleaning\n",
    "2. System checks dataframe for entries that will cause the code to fail and makes sure the code ignores them\n",
    "3. Cleaned dataframe is returned to be used for other functions\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: A dataframe is cleaned and ready to be used for code and making graphs\n",
    "### Data analysis\n",
    "__Actor__: User\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To gain insight on successful athletes and what things are important for their success\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: A clean dataframe and what information that is being intended to analyse\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__:\n",
    "1. User decides on what information to be analysed\n",
    "2. System attempts to generate statistics about the data that the user wishes to know about\n",
    "3. User uses the presented information to make meaning of the properties in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: Statistics that provide meaning about the success of olympic athletes\n",
    "### Data visualisation\n",
    "__Actor__: User or Data analysis process\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To present the statistics generated in the data analysis process or elsewhere to present a chart to the user\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: A clean dataframe or set of statistics\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__:\n",
    "1. User decides on what data to be used\n",
    "2. System finds relevant data in dataframe\n",
    "3. System creates chart with relevant data on it\n",
    "4. User uses the information presented in the chart to make conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: A complete chart of the relevant data that is clear and helpful\n",
    "### Data reporting\n",
    "__Actor__: User\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To save the data that has been created to the computer that uses it for later use\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: Statistics to be used later, or a chart\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__:\n",
    "1. User wants to save the information that they have generated\n",
    "2. System clears space in a designated point for the information to be saved\n",
    "3. System loads the data into the designated point and saves it\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: Data is saved to be used later\n",
    "## Non-functional Requirements\n",
    "### Usability\n",
    "To be useful the UI must be simple to use such that the user can learn how to use the program to perform most of what they require from the program, as well as a README file that accurately and simply explains how to use the UI to perform the desired functions\n",
    "### Reliability\n"
