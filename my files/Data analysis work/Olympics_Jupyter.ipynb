    "__Preconditions__: A clean dataframe and what information that is being intended to analyse\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__:\n",
    "1. User decides on what information to be analysed\n",
    "2. System attempts to generate statistics about the data that the user wishes to know about\n",
    "3. User uses the presented information to make meaning of the properties in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: Statistics that provide meaning about the success of olympic athletes\n",
    "### Data visualisation\n",
    "__Actor__: User or Data analysis process\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To present the statistics generated in the data analysis process or elsewhere to present a chart to the user\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: A clean dataframe or set of statistics\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__:\n",
    "1. User decides on what data to be used\n",
    "2. System finds relevant data in dataframe\n",
    "3. System creates chart with relevant data on it\n",
    "4. User uses the information presented in the chart to make conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: A complete chart of the relevant data that is clear and helpful\n",
    "### Data reporting\n",
    "__Actor__: User\\\n",
    "__Goal__: To save the data that has been created to the computer that uses it for later use\\\n",
    "__Preconditions__: Statistics to be used later, or a chart\\\n",
    "__Main Flow__:\n",
    "1. User wants to save the information that they have generated\n",
    "2. System clears space in a designated point for the information to be saved\n",
    "3. System loads the data into the designated point and saves it\n",
    "\n",
    "__Postconditions__: Data is saved to be used later\n",
    "## Non-functional Requirements\n",
    "### Usability\n",
    "To be useful the UI must be simple to use such that the user can learn how to use the program to perform most of what they require from the program, as well as a README file that must accurately and simply explain how to use the UI to perform the desired functions.\n",
    "### Reliability\n",
    "To be helpful the system must consistently perform the required functions, without changing the outputs that are given to the user. It should also effectively clean the dataset to make good use of it to help the user. The system will also inform the user on when it encounters an error and how the error occured, through the use of different "

    "# Research and Planning\n",
    "## Research of Chosen Issue \n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of my data is to provide further information about the statistical correlation between the success of athletes and the physical characteristics. I believe that this is important to know more about it because it allows people to have better ideas of what people are successful in the Olympics, allowing people to better predict athletes success in their events.\n",
    "### Missing Data\n",
    "While most of the data about the Olympics for the last century is well known, it can be useful to attempt to figure out some more abstract things about the Olympics. An example of this is that our ideas of most countries skill in the Olympics are mostly based on feelings and single data points, like the total amount of medals that a country has earnt, which means that it is hard to track the individual progression of a country's success, for example, a country may have been more successful for a period of time than it has been recent years or the time before that, meaning that it is easier to see these changes.\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "The main people to gain from the information that this would generate would be the general audience of the games. This would be because the audience could better understand the athletes' success and what their success means.\n",
    "### Use\n",
    "This data analysis tool will be able to be used by people who would like to better understand the Olympics and how it will work, and it will be used through the tool to pick out the charateristics, like how it can be predicted that an athlete would do better in a certain event because of their height or nationality. \n",
    "## Privacy and Security\n",
    "### Data Privacy of Source\n",
    "The data that the dataset it gaining is public information, provided by the official Olympics organisation, which means that it doesn't really need to worry about the individual privacy issues of the athletes, however, the data that is accessible in the first place is the thing that could be important in this case. The Olympics organisation needs to think about what data they should show about the athletes, like if they should display the other features of the athlete, like how some of them show the height and weight of athletes, which is definitely a form of private information, but it has been decided that it is fair to show these features, however only for some athletes, probably for the ones that have given permission for the Olympics organisation to use and show these data points.\n",
    "## Application Data Privacy\n",
    "As the tool that I am making is not going to use any of the data from the user, apart from potentialy a login process so only certain people could access the tool. As no private information is shown in the data, I would not have to specially manage the use of the tool, because noone could access any data that they shouldn't\n",
    "## Cyber Security\n",
    "For most software, they require a variety of cybersecurity features. These include: encryption, to prevent people from acccessing things they shouldn't externally through making the data hard to convert, password software, to make it so only specific people can access these things, password hashing, to prevent people from getting passwords when they aren't authorised "
